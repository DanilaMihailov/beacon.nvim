  enabled = true, --- (boolean | fun():boolean) check if enabled
  speed = 2, --- integer speed at wich animation goes
  width = 40, --- integer width of the beacon window
  winblend = 70, --- integer starting transparency of beacon window :h winblend

```

check `:help nvim_set_hl()` for more options.
